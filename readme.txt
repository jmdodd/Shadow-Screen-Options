Create a shadow system of blog-specific screen layout options in a multisite environment.

== Description ==

Shadow Screen Options is used in a multisite environment to allow blog-specific screen layout options 
for users. Blogs on which it is not active will share user-set preferences (the default 
WordPress behavior).

This is most useful in situations where users have several blogs, and have different sets of plugins 
active on each blog.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `shadow-screen-options` folder and its contents to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the "Shadow Screen Options" plugin in your WordPress Plugins administration interface as
needed for individual blogs, or Network Activate.
