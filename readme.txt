Create a shadow system of blog-specific screen layout options in a multisite 
environment.

== Description ==

Shadow Screen Options is used in a multisite environment to allow blog-specific
screen layout options for users. Blogs on which it is not active will share 
user-set preferences (the default WordPress behavior).

This is most useful in situations where users have several blogs, and have
different sets of plugins active on each blog.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the directory `shadow-screen-options` and its contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
